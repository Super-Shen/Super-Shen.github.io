# Biography

### I am a doctoral student at the College of computer science in Jilin University, China and a visiting Ph.D student at Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Trento, Italy. Currently, I am a research member in the large scale european project (EU H2020) [WENET - the internet of us](https://internetofus.eu/). 
### My research is centered on: 
- **Ubiquitous computing:** human activity recognition, mobile sensing and computing
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, federated learning, transfer learning, multimodal learning

I am looking for a suitable position in industry or academia. If there is a suitable position for me, please feel free to contact me!

# News

- **[April  2022]** Our paper about federated learning is accepted to [IJCAI 2022](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/).
